Understood. I’ll prepare a detailed report on the JSON request/response structure of the Gemini API for multimodal access, as used in Google AI Studio. This will include guidance derived from Python implementations and translate it into robust C# examples suitable for production-level use.

I'll also cover all relevant aspects, including:

* Supported input/output modalities (text, image, audio, video, files)
* Authentication, endpoint structures, and payload formatting
* Error handling and edge case considerations
* Example requests/responses
* C# code samples for interacting with the API

I'll get started and let you know as soon as the report is ready.


# Gemini API Multimodal JSON Requests and Responses

## Overview of Gemini Multimodal API

**Google’s Gemini API** is a family of **multimodal generative AI models** supporting **text and various media** (images, audio, video, etc.) as both inputs and outputs. The API is accessible via HTTP endpoints (as seen in Google AI Studio) and expects JSON-formatted requests. Responses are returned as JSON with structured fields. This report details how to construct JSON requests for multimodal interactions and interpret the JSON responses, with a focus on **text, image, audio, and video modalities**. We also cover **public endpoints, error handling, and edge cases** relevant to a production-quality C# implementation.

**Endpoint and Authentication:** All calls use the **Google Generative Language API** endpoint. For example, to use the 2.5 Flash model, you POST to:

```
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent
```

Include your API key in the header (`x-goog-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY`). In C#, you’ll set this header on an `HttpClient` request. The request and response content type is JSON (`application/json`). The model name in the URL can be changed (e.g. `"gemini-2.5-flash"`, `"gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation"`, etc.) depending on the specific Gemini model variant or capability you need.

## JSON Request Format for Multimodal Inputs

All requests use a JSON body with a **`contents`** field that holds an array of content objects. Each content object can contain one or more **parts**, where each part corresponds to a piece of input (text or non-text). In simple cases, you might have just one content with one text part. For multimodal inputs, you include multiple parts (text, image data, audio data, etc.) in the same content entry. Key points about the request structure:

* **Basic Structure:** At minimum, include `contents` as a JSON array. Each element of `contents` is an object with a `"parts"` list. Each part is an object that typically has **either** a `"text"` field **or** a `"file_data"`/`"inline_data"` field (for non-text inputs). For example, a text-only prompt looks like:

  ```json
  {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        { "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words." }
      ]
    }]
  }
  ```

  This is the simplest case of a single text prompt (user message).

* **Including Images (as Input):** To send an image in the prompt, you have two options:

  1. **Inline base64 data:** Embed the image file content as a base64 string using an `"inline_data"` part with a MIME type.
  2. **File reference:** Upload the image via the Files API beforehand and include a `"file_data"` part referencing the file’s URI.

  For *small images*, inline is convenient. For example, if you want to ask the model to modify an image, you can send a text instruction plus the image data in one request. A JSON example with a text part and an inline image part might look like:

  ```json
  {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        { "text": "Hi, this is a picture of me. Can you add a llama next to me?" },
        { "inline_data": {
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "data": "<BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE_DATA>"
        } }
      ]
    }],
    "generationConfig": { "responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"] }
  }
  ```

  In the above JSON, the `mime_type` indicates the image format, and `data` contains the base64 image bytes. The `generationConfig.responseModalities` (discussed later) is requesting the model to return both text and an image. If the image file is large (>20 MB) or reused often, it’s better to use the **Files API** to upload it and then provide a `"file_data"` part with the `file_uri`. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        { "text": "Describe this image" },
        { "file_data": {
            "mime_type": "image/png",
            "file_uri": "gs://your-uploaded-file-uri"
        } }
      ]
    }]
  }
  ```

  This structure attaches a previously uploaded image (PNG) to the prompt. The API will retrieve the file from the given URI (or URL, including support for some public URLs).

* **Including Audio (as Input):** Audio clips can be included similarly. Small audio files (e.g. <20 MB) can be inlined. For instance, to ask the model to summarize an audio clip, you could send:

  ```json
  {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        { "text": "Please summarize the audio." },
        { "inline_data": {
            "mime_type": "audio/mp3",
            "data": "<BASE64_AUDIO_DATA>"
        } }
      ]
    }]
  }
  ```

  Here, the MP3 audio content is embedded directly. For larger or frequently reused audio, upload the file first and use a `"file_data"` part with the `file_uri`. For example, after uploading, the parts might include:

  ```json
  "parts": [
    { "text": "Describe this audio clip" },
    { "file_data": { "mime_type": "audio/mp3", "file_uri": "YOUR_FILE_URI" } }
  ]
  ```

  This references an audio file by URI. **Note:** The total request JSON (including all files inline) must be ≤ **20 MB**. If you exceed this size with inline data, you’ll get an error – in such cases use the upload method.

* **Including Video (as Input):** Gemini can analyze video content as well. Videos can be attached by uploading them (then using `file_data` with the video’s URI and MIME type, e.g. `"video/mp4"`), or by inlining small clips as base64. For instance:

  ```json
  {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        { "inline_data": {
            "mime_type": "video/mp4",
            "data": "<BASE64_VIDEO_DATA>"
        } },
        { "text": "Please summarize the events in this video." }
      ]
    }]
  }
  ```

  This request sends a video file (MP4) along with a prompt. For longer videos (>\~1 minute or >20 MB), use the Files API upload approach. Gemini also supports **YouTube video URLs** directly in a `file_data` part – you can supply a `"file_uri"` with a YouTube link (the model will fetch and process the video). For example, one part could be:

  ```json
  { "file_data": { "file_uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXX" } }
  ```

  (No `mime_type` needed for YouTube URIs.) This is useful for summarization or Q\&A on YouTube content. Keep in mind certain limits (e.g. free tier limits total YouTube video minutes per day) and that only public videos are supported.

**Multiple Contents / Roles:** The `contents` array can contain multiple content objects to provide context or multi-turn conversations. For example, you might include a system message as one content (with an `"author": "SYSTEM"` or similar field in some SDKs) and a user message as another. In the raw JSON API, if using the **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint, you would use a different JSON format with a `messages` list (with `role` and `content`). But using the native Gemini API, the typical pattern is to include *one content object for the user prompt*, possibly preceded by a system instruction content. (The exact mechanism for roles in the raw JSON may vary; Google’s SDK handles roles under the hood, but if needed you can simulate a system prompt by prepending it in the text or using special API fields.)

## Request Configuration for Multimodal Generation

In addition to the `contents`, you can specify a `generationConfig` (sometimes called `config`) object in the JSON to control how the model responds. Important settings include:

* **Response Modalities:** By default, Gemini models will return text. If you want the model to generate **non-text outputs** (like images or audio), you must request it. In JSON, this is done via `generationConfig.responseModalities`. For example, to ask Gemini to generate an image along with text, set `"responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]` in the request. Similarly, for text-to-speech (speech generation), use `["AUDIO"]` (or `["TEXT","AUDIO"]` if you also want a textual transcript) as the response modalities. This signals the model to produce those output types when possible. *Note:* Not all models support all modalities – ensure you use a model variant that can generate the modality you request (e.g., use the *Flash* model versions for multimodal features, or specific preview models for image generation as noted below).

* **Model Selection for Outputs:** As of now, **image generation** with Gemini is available in **preview** via models like `"gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation"`. You would use that model name with `responseModalities: ["TEXT","IMAGE"]` to generate an image from a prompt. (Gemini 2.5 may integrate image generation in the future, but the current documentation uses the 2.0 preview model for native image outputs.) For **speech generation (TTS)**, there is a model `"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts"` which can output audio. In requests to that model, you include `responseModalities: ["AUDIO"]` and can also specify a `speechConfig` with voice parameters. For example, you might request the “Kore” prebuilt voice:

  ```json
  "generationConfig": {
      "responseModalities": ["AUDIO"],
      "speechConfig": {
          "voiceConfig": { "prebuiltVoiceConfig": { "voiceName": "Kore" } }
      }
  }
  ```

  This would generate spoken audio (returned as waveform data) for the given text prompt.

* **Other Generation Settings:** You can control text generation parameters in `generationConfig` such as `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`, `topP`, `candidateCount`, etc., similar to other generative models. If not specified, defaults are used. For example, to get multiple completions, you could set `"candidateCount": 3` to receive 3 candidate answers in the response. The range of valid values is documented (e.g. up to 8 candidates max). If you set a **“thinking”** budget (Gemini’s reasoning mode), that goes under a `thinkingConfig` in `generationConfig` – by default Gemini 2.5 Flash does some reasoning automatically, but you can adjust or disable it. (Setting `"thinkingBudget": 0` in the thinking config will trade off some quality for speed/cost.)

* **Safety Settings:** By default, Google applies safety filters. You can adjust the safety settings via a `safetySettings` array in the request (each with a category and threshold) if needed, though most users keep defaults. Just be aware that if the model deems the request or content unsafe, it may refuse or filter content.

## JSON Response Structure

The Gemini API responds with a JSON object containing the model’s output. Understanding the fields is critical for parsing results in your C# library:

* **Candidates:** The top-level JSON contains a `"candidates"` array. Each element in this list is one generated response (completion). Typically, if you didn’t request multiple candidates, there will be exactly one. Each candidate has a **`content`** field and possibly some metadata. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "candidates": [
      {
        "content": {
          "parts": [
            { "text": "<some response text>" },
            { "inline_data": { "mime_type": "image/png", "data": "<BASE64_IMAGE>" } }
          ]
        },
        "finishReason": "FINISH_REASON_STOP",
        "safetyRatings": [ { "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "probability": "LOW", "blocked": false } ],
        "usageMetadata": { ... }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  In this example structure (illustrative), the first candidate’s content has two parts: one text part and one inline\_data part (an image) – meaning the model returned some text followed by an image. This corresponds to having requested both text and image in the response. Generally, **`candidate.content.parts`** is an array of **segments of the response**, each segment being either text or binary data. For text-only outputs, there’s usually a single part with a `"text"` field. For image or audio outputs, the parts might be interleaved (e.g., a description then an image, or just one audio part, etc.).

* **Accessing the Text:** To extract the text answer, you typically take `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text` (if the first part is text). In many examples, Google’s code does exactly that. If you requested an image or other modality, you should iterate over `parts`. For instance, in pseudocode:

  ```csharp
  foreach (var part in candidate.content.parts) {
      if (part.text != null) { /* handle text */ }
      else if (part.inline_data != null) { /* handle binary data */ }
  }
  ```

  In the JSON, note the naming: the response uses `"inlineData"` (camelCase) in some SDKs, but in raw JSON it appears as `"inline_data"` (snake\_case), same as the request format.

* **Binary Data Outputs:** If the model returns an **image**, **audio**, or other binary content, it will appear in the JSON under an `"inline_data"` object within a part. The `inline_data` includes at least a `data` field, which is the base64-encoded content, and a `mime_type`. For example, an image generated by Gemini might come as:

  ```json
  ... "parts": [ { "inline_data": { "mime_type": "image/png", "data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." } } ] ...
  ```

  The base64 string can be very long. Your C# code should take the `data` string, decode it (e.g. `Convert.FromBase64String`), and save or process the bytes (e.g. save to a `.png` file). In Google’s reference cURL commands, they demonstrate piping the `data` through base64 decode to save the image file. Similarly, audio output (from text-to-speech) is returned as base64 PCM data (commonly 24 kHz, mono, 16-bit samples). You would decode and possibly save as “.wav” (after adding the WAV header or using a library to do so). Always use the `mime_type` to handle the data appropriately (e.g., `"audio/wav"` or `"audio/mp3"` for audio, `"image/png"` or `"image/jpeg"` for images).

* **Finish Reason:** Each candidate may include a `"finishReason"` indicating why generation stopped. Common values are `FINISH_REASON_STOP` (ended normally or hit a stop sequence) or `FINISH_REASON_MAX_TOKENS` (stopped because it reached token limit). There are also reasons related to safety: for example, `FINISH_REASON_SAFETY` means generation was halted due to a safety filter trigger. **Important:** If content was blocked for safety, the **candidate’s content might be empty** (no parts). In such cases, you might see `finishReason: FINISH_REASON_SAFETY` and need to handle that as “no answer due to safety”. Your code should check if `candidates[0].content.parts` exists and has elements before assuming a valid answer.

* **Safety Ratings:** The response can also include a `"safetyRatings"` array with entries for various categories (hate speech, violence, etc.), each with a `probability` and a `blocked` boolean. For instance, you might see something like:

  ```json
  "safetyRatings": [
    { "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "probability": "LOW", "blocked": false }
  ]
  ```

  These indicate the model’s assessment of its output content. If any `blocked: true`, it means that portion was flagged/removed. In practice, if a response was blocked, you’d likely see no content and the finishReason as discussed above. However, logging these ratings might be useful for auditing.

* **Usage and Other Metadata:** The JSON may contain a `"usageMetadata"` object with token counts (`promptTokenCount`, `candidatesTokenCount`, `totalTokenCount`) for billing and analysis. It can also include `modelVersion` (the specific model iteration that served the request). There might be `citationMetadata` if the model provided citations (for models that support retrieving sources), or `thoughts` if you enabled the “thinking” feature with `includeThoughts`. In general, these fields provide extra info but aren’t required to simply get the content.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

A robust C# library should handle API errors and special cases gracefully. Here are common issues and how to handle them:

* **HTTP Errors (4xx/5xx):** The Gemini API will return standard HTTP error codes with error details in JSON if something goes wrong. Some common ones:

  * **400 Bad Request**: This typically means the JSON request was malformed or a parameter is invalid (e.g., missing required field or using an unsupported model name/version). Double-check your JSON structure and values if you get 400. The error message from the API may indicate what’s wrong (e.g., “INVALID\_ARGUMENT”).
  * **403 Forbidden**: Indicates an authentication or permission issue – e.g., using an API key that doesn’t have access or trying to use a premium model without proper credentials. Ensure your API key is correct and has access permissions.
  * **404 Not Found**: This can happen if you reference a file that doesn’t exist or use a wrong endpoint URL. For example, if a `file_uri` is incorrect or expired, or if the model name in the URL is wrong, you’ll get a 404. The docs note this often means a referenced image/audio/video file wasn’t found or an invalid parameter was used.
  * **429 Too Many Requests (Rate Limit)**: You’ve hit the quota/limits (requests per minute, etc.). The response will indicate that the resource is exhausted. In this case, you should throttle your requests or request a higher quota if needed.
  * **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error on Google’s side – sometimes caused by very large inputs or context that the model couldn’t handle. For instance, if your prompt plus attachments exceed the model’s processing capacity, you might see a 500 with a message about input being too long. The guidance is to reduce input size or try a smaller model if this recurs.
  * **503/504 Service Unavailable/Timeout**: These indicate the service is temporarily overloaded or the request took too long. A strategy here is to implement retries with backoff in your library for robustness.

  In all error cases, the API typically returns a JSON with an `"error"` field containing a message and error status. Your C# code can parse that to throw meaningful exceptions. Also, ensure you handle network errors (e.g., inability to reach the endpoint).

* **Large Inputs Handling:** As mentioned, inline data is limited by size. If the user tries to inline a huge image or video, your library should detect size and optionally use the upload method. Google’s documentation explicitly says **20 MB** is the max for a request including inline files. Exceeding that will likely result in a 400 error. You might preemptively check `if (file.Length > 20MB)` and perform an upload (the Files API returns a `file_uri` you can then use in the generateContent call).

* **Multimodal Availability:** Not all modalities may be enabled in all regions or tiers. For example, **image generation** was not available in certain regions and might require enabling billing (the free tier might restrict it). If a feature is not available, the API might return a **FAILED\_PRECONDITION** error saying the feature or model isn’t accessible (e.g., “free tier is not available in your country” for some models). The solution might be enabling billing or using a region where it’s allowed.

* **Safety Blocks:** As discussed, if the content is disallowed, the model may **return an empty result with a safety finish reason**. Your code should handle this by checking if `candidates` array is empty or if the first candidate’s content has no parts. In such cases, you might surface a specific exception or an indication that the content was blocked by safety filters. The `safetyRatings` may also have `blocked: true` for a category that triggered the block. For example, if the user prompt requests something against policy, you might get a response with no content and safety flagged. As an edge case, the model might also stop mid-response if it detects an issue (resulting in a partial output and a safety finish reason).

* **Partial or No Modality in Response:** Even if you request an image output, **Gemini might sometimes return only text** (for instance, if it decides an image isn’t necessary or if it “failed” to generate one). Your code should not assume an image will always be present even if asked; always check the parts. The documentation notes that you may need to explicitly prompt for an image (“generate an image of …”) to encourage the model. Similarly, in some cases the model might produce multiple images or interleaved text and images (especially in creative modes), so be prepared to handle multiple parts in sequence.

* **Streaming vs. Non-Streaming:** The Gemini API also supports a streaming endpoint (`streamGenerateContent`) which returns chunks of the response incrementally. If you implement streaming in C#, note that the JSON structure might arrive in parts that you need to concatenate (in streaming, the text may be split into multiple parts or events). However, if you are using the standard `generateContent` as covered here, you get the full JSON at once. The response structure is the same, but streaming adds fields like `candidateEpoch` and requires merging the parts. Since streaming is a specialized use-case, we focus on the standard call in this report.

## C# Code Example – Multimodal Request and Response

Below is an example illustrating how you might implement a call to Gemini’s API in C#. This example will send a text prompt along with an image, and request the model to return an edited image (as well as some explanatory text). It uses `HttpClient` to POST the JSON and then processes the JSON response. (For brevity, proper error catching is omitted, but should be included in production code.)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Nodes;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class GeminiApiExample {
    static async Task Main() {
        string apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
        string endpoint = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation:generateContent";

        // 1. Read image file and encode to base64
        byte[] imageBytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("input_image.jpg");
        string imageBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(imageBytes);

        // 2. Construct the JSON request body
        var requestBody = new {
            contents = new object[] {
                new {
                    parts = new object[] {
                        new { text = "Can you add a llama next to the person in this image?" },
                        new { inline_data = new { mime_type = "image/jpeg", data = imageBase64 } }
                    }
                }
            },
            generationConfig = new {
                responseModalities = new string[] { "TEXT", "IMAGE" }
            }
        };
        string requestJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(requestBody);

        // 3. Send the HTTP POST request
        using HttpClient http = new HttpClient();
        http.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-goog-api-key", apiKey);
        HttpResponseMessage response = await http.PostAsync(endpoint,
                                    new StringContent(requestJson, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));
        string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error {response.StatusCode}: {responseContent}");
            return;
        }

        // 4. Parse the JSON response
        JsonNode json = JsonNode.Parse(responseContent)!;
        var candidates = json["candidates"]?.AsArray();
        if (candidates == null || candidates.Count == 0) {
            Console.WriteLine("No candidates returned (response may have been filtered or empty).");
            return;
        }
        JsonNode firstCandidate = candidates[0]!;
        var parts = firstCandidate["content"]?["parts"]?.AsArray();
        if (parts == null) {
            Console.WriteLine("No content parts in the response.");
            return;
        }

        // 5. Iterate through parts and handle text or image data
        int imageCount = 0;
        foreach (JsonNode part in parts) {
            if (part?["text"] != null) {
                string textOutput = part["text"]!.GetValue<string>();
                Console.WriteLine("Model Text: " + textOutput);
            }
            else if (part?["inline_data"] != null) {
                // This is an image (or other binary) part
                string mime = part["inline_data"]!["mime_type"]!.GetValue<string>();
                string base64Data = part["inline_data"]!["data"]!.GetValue<string>();
                try {
                    byte[] dataBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(base64Data);
                    string extension = mime.EndsWith("png") ? ".png" : ".jpg";
                    string fileName = $"output_image_{++imageCount}{extension}";
                    System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, dataBytes);
                    Console.WriteLine($"Image output saved as {fileName} (MIME: {mime})");
                } catch (FormatException) {
                    Console.WriteLine("Failed to decode base64 image data.");
                }
            }
        }

        // 6. (Optional) Check metadata like finishReason or safety
        string? finishReason = firstCandidate["finishReason"]?.GetValue<string>();
        if (finishReason != null) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Finish reason: {finishReason}");
        }
        bool wasBlocked = false;
        foreach (JsonNode rating in firstCandidate["safetyRatings"]?.AsArray() ?? new JsonArray()) {
            bool blocked = rating["blocked"]?.GetValue<bool>() ?? false;
            if (blocked) wasBlocked = true;
        }
        if (wasBlocked) {
            Console.WriteLine("Warning: The content was flagged/modified by safety filters.");
        }
    }
}
```

**What this code does:**

1. Reads an input JPEG image and encodes it as base64.
2. Constructs the JSON payload with a text instruction and the image (as `inline_data`). It asks the model to produce an image output (`responseModalities` includes `"IMAGE"`).
3. Posts the request to the appropriate model endpoint (using the preview image-generation model).
4. Checks for errors. If the call failed (non-200 status), it prints the error details (which may include a message like "INVALID\_ARGUMENT" or other info in the `responseContent`).
5. Parses the JSON response. It then accesses the `candidates[0].content.parts` array.
6. Iterates through each part: if it’s text, prints it; if it’s inline data (an image in this case), it decodes the base64 and saves it to a file. We also handle the MIME type to decide an extension.
7. Finally, it fetches the `finishReason` (if present) and checks any safety ratings. If any part was blocked, it notes that. This is purely for logging; in a real library, you might expose these to the caller or take action if something was blocked.

When running such code, you might get output like:

```
Model Text: Sure! Here's the image with a llama added next to you.
Image output saved as output_image_1.png (MIME: image/png)
Finish reason: FINISH_REASON_STOP
```

This indicates the model returned some confirmation text and one image, and it ended normally. If something went wrong (e.g., safety blocked), the finish reason or logs would reflect that.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Gemini API uses a structured JSON format for both requests and responses to handle multimodal AI interactions. A C# integration will involve constructing the proper JSON (especially handling file data vs. inline data for media), sending it to the correct endpoint with an API key, and then parsing the JSON response for the content (text, images, audio, etc.) while also minding metadata like `finishReason` and safety.

When building a production-grade library, pay extra attention to **error handling** (HTTP errors, timeouts, etc.) and **edge cases** (like content blocking, or the absence of expected fields). The examples and patterns from Google’s documentation provide a solid reference – for instance, the presence of `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text` in a successful response, or an error code indicating a missing file. By following these patterns and using robust JSON parsing, your C# library can confidently interface with Gemini’s multimodal capabilities.

**Sources:** The information and examples above are based on the official Google Gemini API documentation and Google Cloud Vertex AI references, including usage of contents/parts for multimodal requests, configuring responses for images/audio, understanding response JSON structure, and recommended error handling practices. These sources provide deeper insights and additional examples for different scenarios.
